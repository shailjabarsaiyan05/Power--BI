The Significant Earthquake Dataset for the period of 1900-2023 is a comprehensive collection of data on major earthquakes that have occurred worldwide over
the past 123 years. This dataset is compiled and maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC). 
It is regularly updated to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information on earthquake events.

The dataset includes information on over 37,000 earthquakes that have occurred in this period, with each entry containing details such as the earthquake's date, 
time, location, magnitude, and depth.

The dataset is a valuable resource for seismologists, geologists, and other researchers who study earthquakes, as well as for emergency management 
officials and other professionals who work in disaster response and preparedness. It is also a valuable resource for the general public interested in 
learning more about the history of earthquakes and their impact on human societies.
